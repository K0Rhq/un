# unDocs

## v0.1.0-alpha

Build your docs in an Astro site, using unstyled docs primitives and schemas with all the functionality built in. Style it with your own brand and layout. Integrate within your current website.

This package provides schemas, recommended structures and helper functions to help you build your own docs UI. Right now, you have to build the UI and structure yourself. In the future, we'll have a CLI with presets available. We also hope to offer headless, unstyled documentation components such as file trees, better codeblocks/tabs, steps, and various plugins that you can style yourself.
